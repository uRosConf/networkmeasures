# Network measures uRos 2019 Unconf project

## Topic

We are interested in quantifying complexity of network or graph data e.g. traffic, family or business network.


## Idea

1) Implement the unweighted global efficieny measure for an igraph network (reference)
- naive implementation, using the average inverse shortest path between all the nodes
2) Implement the unweighted local efficiency measure.
